**Maze_Solver**

This project is a Perfect maze solver. But what is a perfect maze ?
A perfect maze is a maze that has no loops and no clusters; therefore, following a wall makes us cross the entire maze.
It will print the solved maze in the terminal. The final path will be filled with 'o' characters.

The begining of the maze must be in the top-left corner (O, O) and the end must be in the bottom-right corner.
