**Maze_Solver**

This project is a Perfect maze solver. But what is a perfect maze ?
A perfect maze is a maze that has no loops and no clusters; therefore, following a wall makes us cross the entire maze.
It will print the solved maze in the terminal. The final path will be filled with 'o' characters.

**RUN**

./maze_solver maze.txt

**MAP**

The begining of the maze must be in the top-left corner (O, O) and the end must be in the bottom-right corner.
